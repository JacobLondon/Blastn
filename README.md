# To Do
* Python finish implementation
* Need to make a JSON file with options for each file
* Create Dockerfile for the Python environment
* Create a Python test file using subprocess.call to automatically call command line programs for testing
* Save C++ files as STL/JSON for steps
  * For testing
  * The end-goal is to have a main file which calls and passes the objects directly instead of saving to a file
* Create a file with an explanation for the steps needed to run the Python program
